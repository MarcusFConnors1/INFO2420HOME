<h2>Cooking for Family and Friends</h2>

<!-- Example image for this tribute -->

<p>
My favorite past time is cooking. I especially like cooking for family and
friends. I was glad to find this web site about Native Cooking of Utah.
</p>

<p>
I like to make sure the items I choose to cook meet the needs of my target
audience. I have found the recipes in this collection to be wildly popular
with my Utah neighbors and family members.
</p>

<p>
My family especially loves the raspberry cake recipe. I am enclosing a photo
of my version of the cake.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for adding spice to my cooking,
</p>

<h2>Expanding My Utahan Repertoire</h2>

<!-- Example image for this tribute -->
<img src="/Project3/Tributes/Images/GreenJello2Sm.jpg" alt="Green Jello" class="float-right">

<p>
My name is Daisy Daniels and I have enjoyed using the recipes I have found at
your web site. I thought I already knew how to cook like a Utahan, but I have
been able to expand my repertoire after trying out some of your more unusual
offerings.
</p>

<p>
I like how these recipes are inexpensive to prepare, and they serve lots of
people. The clean up usually is painless as well.
</p>

<p>
I loved your green jello recipe. My family makes sure we never have leftovers
when I fix this one.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for everything,
</p>

<h2>Dinner Made Easy</h2>

<!-- Example image for this tribute -->
<img src="/Project3/Tributes/Images/RasberryIceCreamSm.jpg" alt="Bear Lake Raspberry Ice Cream" class="float-left">

<p>
Whenever I am at a loss about what to cook for dinner, I just go to your web
site and I can always find an answer.
</p>

<p>
The ingredients of your recipes are always reasonably priced so I won't have
to worry about busting my budget.
</p>

<p>
I was nervous about trying to make my own ice cream, but your Bear Lake
Raspberry recipe made me brave enough to try it. The step by step directions
were easy to follow and my kids really loved the ice cream. I am attaching a
photo.
</p>

<p>
I scream for your ice cream,
</p>

<h2>Dutch Oven Success</h2>

<!-- Example image for this tribute -->
<img src="/Project3/Tributes/Images/DutchOvenSm.jpg" alt="Dutch Oven Cooking" class="float-right">

<p>
Real men are not afraid to try Dutch oven cooking. I made an investment in
equipment, but it sat in my garage until I found your wonderful recipes
online.
</p>

<p>
Now, I am a hit at family reunions and campouts. I have tried main dishes,
desserts, and even baked rolls.
</p>

<p>
My next attempt will be lasagna. Thanks for giving me the courage to try
cooking the old fashioned way.
</p>

<p>
Warmly yours,
</p>
